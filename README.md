Hi, I'm Michael Kollasch. 
I'm a fast learner and have taken on the challenge of developing coding skills to complement my analytical ability.
I'm excited about developing visualizations to more clearly show the meaning in data.
I'm passionate about making the world a better place and finding ways to help others.
I'd love to connect with you, especially if you are a data professional.  my e-mail is mrkollasch@gmail.com
Pronouns: he/him
Fun fact: I play the guitar at church and even sing! I also volunteer time as a youth leader and have been a deacon.
