Hi, I'm Michael Kollasch. 
I'm an analytical thinker, trained chemical engineer, and a fast learner and have recently completed a Data Science and Visualization Bootcamp.
I'm excited about applying my years of experience and old and new skills in the workplace and would love to do so in the ESG/GHG arena.
I'm passionate about making the world a better place and finding ways to help others.
I'd love to connect with you, especially if you are a data professional.  my e-mail is mrkollasch@gmail.com
Pronouns: he/him
Fun fact: I play the guitar at church and even sing! I also volunteer time as a youth leader and have been a deacon.  I've had the honor of participating in finding and on-boarding a pastoral resident on two occasions.
