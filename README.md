Hi, I'm Michael Kollasch. 
I'm a fast learner and have taken on the challenge of developing coding skills for working with big data to complement my analytical ability.
I'm excited about applying my experience and skills to the ESG/GHG arena.
I'm passionate about making the world a better place and finding ways to help others.
I'd love to connect with you, especially if you are a data professional.  my e-mail is mrkollasch@gmail.com
Pronouns: he/him
Fun fact: I play the guitar at church and even sing! I also volunteer time as a youth leader and have been a deacon.  I've had the honor of participating in finding and on-boarding a pastoral resident on two occasions.
